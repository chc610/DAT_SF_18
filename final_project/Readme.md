Hi. I'm Chun Hei Chow. I'm a recent graduate from UC Berkeley; majored in Applied Mathematics with a concrentration in Mathematical Cryptography. I come from Hong Kong and did high school there. I have also lived in Canada and the UK. I moved to Canada when I was young and lived there for 4 years. I went to UK for a year of college. I just finished a research job on Lattice Cryptography. 

I love karaoke and have taken singing lessons to try to get better. I am still not the best singer but I am still learning and improving.
